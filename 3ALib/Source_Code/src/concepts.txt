the client is using only the AvailabilityAuditor, by inserting keys, provider and service name

for google, we need to get the p12 file from the google platform, pass it through openssl to remove the password:
openssl pkcs12 -in {downloaded_file}.p12 -nodes -out gcp-example.pem -passin pass:notasecret

and the resulting pem file is stored locally. In the conf file we insert the location of the pem file.
Username is the mail id key in the google platform
Modifications have also been inserted in the GoogleComputeSlAAuditor that gets as input the pem file.

Abstractions: interface for all specific auditors that need to implement it
AbsrtactedGetserver: get computeservice object, handle differently per provider (different type of information needed)

README: status may be achieved through pinging

to enable pinging, one must implement the following actions:

a) AWS: change in the security group of the VM instances the rules to include allowing of ICMP traffic
in case we need to enable it also in the VMs we may issue the following command:
 sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j ACCEPT
 
 
 
b) different OS versions taken under consideration (command is different in Windows and Linux)

c) Decision is  based on Average reported value. By default, ping function has average if even 1 sample 
gets through. We consider the same condition. 


d) Pinging is decided in common with the pinging of 8.8.8.8, to ensure general connectivity of the client


e) Changing the way we implement reachability decision needs a new class that implements the DecideReachability
interface (and replacement in the class that the reachability decision is called)
